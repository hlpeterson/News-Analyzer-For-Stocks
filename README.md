# Financial News Analysis for Trading Stocks
## Through the advent of using machine learning techniques such as sentiment analysis, this project attempts to construct an algorithm which will be able to classify current headlines as either positive or negative in order to inform investors about which stocks may be poised to trade favorably/unfavorably.
### Componenets
#### Generating the Latest Headlines 
##### This project employs the API found at newsapi.org in order to access which headlines are currently in the news. The API call uses the parameters "business" (category), "en" (language), and "usa" (country) in order to only include headlines which are relevant to the current business news of the United States.
#### Classifying the Headlines
##### This project uses a Naive Bayes machine learning algorithm on the dataset “Sentiment Analysis for Financial News”, which was posted onto kaggle.com by user Ankur Sinha (link to webpage: https://www.kaggle.com/ankurzing/sentiment-analysis-for-financial-news). The provided acknowledegment can be found at the bottom of this page under the "Acknowledgements" section. This data is licensed under the Creative Commons BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. The algorithm uses the TfidfVectorizer and MultinomialNB functions from the scikit-learn library in order correlate the given phrases as being positive, negative, or neutral.
#### Analyzing the Model
##### In order to assess the performance of this model, the data was first split into a "Train" subset (80% of the original dataset) and a "Test" subset (20% of the original dataset). The results of this training procedure, as shown through a confusion matrix, indicated that, while the model was extremely efficient at identify neutral headlines as neutral, it also wrongly identified many headlines with positive or negative connations as neutral. Because of this, the model was extremely inaccurate when attempting to correctly identify a headline as positive or negative, and, since these are the only types of articles relevant to this application's particular use case (measuring future stock trends), this severely hinders the usefulness of the application. Further, when a cross validation model was used to train and test the data, the mean accuracy was roughly 65%, which is not nearly high enough for a trader to be able to make consistently accurate decisions. For the future, I plan on looking for other ways to improve the data and the model in order to create a more accurate application.
